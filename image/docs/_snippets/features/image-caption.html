		The <strong>common blackbird</strong> (<em>Turdus merula</em>) is a species of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_thrush" title="">true thrush&nbsp;<img src="%BASE_PATH%/assets/img/wikipedia_icon.png" alt="Read more on Wikipedia" style="width: 18px"></a></a>. It is also called the <strong>Eurasian blackbird</strong> (especially in North America, to distinguish it from the unrelated <em>New World blackbirds</em>), or simply the <strong>blackbird</strong>. It has a number of subspecies across its large range; a few of the Asian subspecies are sometimes considered to be full species. Depending on latitude, the common blackbird may be resident, partially migratory, or fully migratory.

The adult female bird is called a <strong>hen</strong>. &quot;Chicken&quot; was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird, but thanks to its usage on restaurant menus has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in American English.
