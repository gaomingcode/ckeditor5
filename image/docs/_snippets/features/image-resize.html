		Rail freight transport is the use of railroads and trains to transport cargo as opposed to human passengers.
	</p>
	<p>
		A freight train, cargo train, or goods train is a group of freight cars hauled by one or more locomotives on a railway, transporting cargo all or some of the way between the shipper and the intended destination as part of the logistics chain. Trains may haul bulk material, intermodal containers, general freight or specialized freight in purpose-designed cars. Rail freight practices and economics vary by country and region.
